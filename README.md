# Hello! My name is reimakesgames!

I program games in Luau and C#. I make music in FL Studio and LMMS. I also make art in FireAlpaca and Ibispaint X.

## Skills and Projects

My programming expertise is mostly in Luau, but I do know a bit of JS. I am currently learning C#.

I am currently working on a mega project similar to VALORANT named [AIMLESS](https://github.com/reimakesgames/hybrid-conflict)

I am also working on a game called [Misadventure](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) in Godot with C#. Have fun connecting the dots~
